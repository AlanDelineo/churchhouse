I tell you what, this serverless stuff might be a bit good.

This has spun up in no time, edits are super quick and if this works as expected we can have a simple working CMS.

I'm going to try something stupid next like setting up a OTT carousel and see how that effects the page speed/lighthouse score.

Woo!

So this was orignally added via the CMS, but if I add more content here and commit from my local machine this is going to update!

I'm fairly sure this is witchcraft.
