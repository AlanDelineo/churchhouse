I tell you what, this serverless stuff might be a bit good.

This has spun up in no time, edits are super quick and if this works as expected we can have a simple working CMS.

I'm going to try something stupid next like setting up a OTT carousel and see how that effects the page speed/lighthouse score.

Woo!
